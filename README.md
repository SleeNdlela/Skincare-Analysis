# **Product Information and Reviews Analysis**

## **Overview**
This project analyzes product and review data to extract meaningful insights. The dataset includes product details, pricing, reviews, and customer interactions. The goal is to use this data for understanding customer preferences, product performance, and key attributes influencing sales and satisfaction.

---

## **Dataset Description**
The dataset contains two main components:
1. **Product Information**: Details about products, including pricing, variations, and highlights.
2. **Reviews Data**: Customer reviews with ratings, recommendations, and additional feedback.

### **Key Columns**
#### Product Information
- **product_id**: Unique product identifier.
- **product_name**: Full product name.
- **brand_id**: Unique brand identifier.
- **brand_name**: Name of the product brand.
- **loves_count**: Number of users who marked the product as a favorite.
- **rating**: Average user rating.
- **price_usd**: Product price in USD.
- **limited_edition**, **online_only**, **out_of_stock**, etc.: Boolean indicators of product attributes.
- **primary_category**, **secondary_category**, **tertiary_category**: Categorization details.

#### Reviews Data
- **author_id**: Unique identifier for the
- review author.  
- **rating**: Rating provided by the customer (1–5 scale).  
- **is_recommended**: Whether the product is recommended by the reviewer (1 for yes, 0 for no).  
- **helpfulness**: Ratio of positive to total feedback for the review.  
- **review_text**: The main text of the review.  
- **review_title**: Title of the review.  
- **skin_tone**, **eye_color**, **skin_type**, **hair_color**: Reviewer demographics (if available).

## **Project Objectives**
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and standardize formats to ensure data quality.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Analyze pricing trends, product popularity, and review sentiments.  
   - Identify top-rated brands and categories.  
   - Explore correlations between features like `price_usd`, `rating`, and `loves_count`.  
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create additional features for better insights (e.g., discount percentages, normalized ratings).  
4. **Insights Extraction**:  
   - Highlight best-performing products and categories.  
   - Analyze user feedback for recurring themes.  
   - Identify opportunities for product improvement.

## **Steps in the Project**

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handle missing values in columns like `rating`, `reviews`, and `price_usd`.  
   - Parse lists in `ingredients` and `highlights`.  
   - Standardize size formats for consistency.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Analyze the distribution of ratings and reviews.  
   - Investigate the impact of discounts (`value_price_usd` vs. `price_usd`) on sales.  
   - Visualize `loves_count` trends across categories and brands.  

3. **Insights and Visualizations**  
   - Identify top brands/products based on `loves_count`, `rating`, and reviews.  
   - Detect patterns in `helpfulness` scores for reviews.  
   - Understand how product attributes like `limited_edition` or `sephora_exclusive` affect customer preferences.  

4. **Conclusions and Recommendations**  
   - Provide actionable insights for improving products and marketing strategies.  
   - Highlight opportunities for introducing new product lines or variations.

## **Technologies and Tools**
- **Python Libraries**:  
   - `pandas` for data cleaning and manipulation.  
   - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualizations.  
   - `numpy` for numerical analysis.  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive development and visualization.
- **Streamlit** (Optional): For building a dashboard to present findings.

## **Usage**
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the analysis script:  
   ```bash
   python analysis.py
   ```
4. (Optional) Launch the dashboard:  
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

---

## **Results**
Key findings will be summarized here after the analysis is completed, including:  
- Most loved and best-reviewed products.  
- Key pricing trends and insights.  
- Recommendations for product development and marketing strategies.

---

## **Future Work**
- Build predictive models to recommend products based on customer preferences.  
- Analyze sentiment in review texts using Natural Language Processing (NLP).  
- Develop a live dashboard for real-time insights.
